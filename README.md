# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

The code (run_analysis.R) merges the training and the test sets to create one data set called 'complete_humanactivity_dataset'
The code uses decriptive activity names (Walking, Walking_Upstairs, Walking_Downstairs, Sitting, Standing, Laying) to label activities in the 'activity' column in the 'complete_humanactivity_dataset'
The code extracts the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement and creates another dataset called 'final_humanactivity_dataset'
The code labels the 'final_humanactivity_dataset' with descriptive variable names 
The code creates a second, independent 'tidy_dataset' with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject from the 'final_humanactivity_dataset'
