Variables in the Tidy Dataset 

1. subject - The unique ID of each subject which was obtained by reading in the subject_test and subject_train text files 

2. activity - Activity performed by each subject which was obtained by reading the y_test and y_train files and recoded as follows by referencing the activity_labels text file: 
    
    1- WALKING
    2- WALKING_UPSTAIRS
    3- WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
    4- SITTING
    5- STANDING
    6- LAYING
    
3. Columns 3:68 consist of the measurements on the mean and standard deviation of each measurement. These were obtained by 
    a. Reading in the subject_test and subject_train text files 
    b. Creating a combined dataset 'complete_humanactivity_dataset'
    c. Extracting measurements for mean and standard deviations and storing them in the 'Mean_std_complete_humanactivity_dataset'

The final 'tidy dataset' was created by combining all these columns together and averaging each variable for each activity and each subject.
